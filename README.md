# Employee_Churn_Prediction
This project analyzes employee survey data from Salifort Motors, a fictional electric vehicle manufacturer, to predict employee departure. It utilizes a [chosen model type (regression or tree-based machine learning)] model to identify factors influencing retention and provide insights for improving employee satisfaction.

## Predicting Employee Retention at Salifort Motors

## Overview

Welcome to the Predicting Employee Retention project repository! This project was completed as part of the capstone project for the  Google Advanced Data Analytics certificate program. In this project, we explore employee survey data from Salifort Motors, a fictional French-based alternative energy vehicle manufacturer, to develop a model that predicts employee retention.

## Project Description

As a data specialist working for Salifort Motors, the task was to analyze the results of a recent employee survey and design a model to predict whether an employee will leave the company. Key features such as department, number of projects, and average monthly hours were used to build the predictive model.

## Getting Started

To explore this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   
   git clone https://github.com/AniketLahiri2003/predicting-employee-retention.git
   

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   
   cd predicting-employee-retention
   

3. Explore the notebooks/ directory to view the Jupyter Notebooks containing the data analysis and model building process.

4. Check out the reports/ directory for the executive summary and any additional reports generated from the analysis.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- *Data Exploration*: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to gain insights into the dataset.
- *Feature Engineering*: Relevant features were engineered based on EDA findings and domain knowledge.
- *Model Building*: Regression(Logistic) and tree-based machine learning model (Decision Tree) were trained and evaluated for predicting employee retention.
- *Model Interpretation*: Results of the models were interpreted to understand the key factors influencing employee retention.
- *Ethical Considerations*: Ethical implications of the analysis were considered throughout the project.

## Conclusion

The Predicting Employee Retention project provides valuable insights into employee retention at Salifort Motors. By leveraging advanced data analytics techniques, I have developed a predictive model that can assist the senior leadership team in making informed decisions to improve employee retention strategies.
